# DevOps-Core-Fundamental-Project: 
## Harry Potter Sorting Hat

This is a basic web app intended to allow users (Users aka Prospective Students) to register to attend each of the four houses at Hogwarts.

As a MVP two tables will be included in a relational db.  Users enter their name via a form and request to join one of the four houses.
Their name is then appended to a list of students within each house.

Ideally I will try to include a random element to assign houses (sorting hat) and potentially will extend to include another table, student 
years.
