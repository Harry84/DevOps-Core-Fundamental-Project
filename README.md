# DevOps-Core-Fundamental-Project: 
## Squadrons Pilot Skills Database

This is a basic web app intended to allow users (Star War: Squadrons Pilots) to store and retrieve information relating to
their piloting skills on a database via webforms.  The intention is to have a reasonably comprehensive piloting skill-set
whereby each skill has a corresponding score out of 10.  This will allow pilots to see at a glance what areas they can improve on
and how they compare to their peers, both within their squadron and in other squadrons.

Ultimately in the future I would like to extend the project to include statistical feedback for pilots whereby performance to date
is directly tied to their scores/in game stats.  In turn this would direct them along learning pathways whereby they would be instructed to complete
drills and exercises tailor made to drive their improvement via identifying strengths and weaknesses and suggesting the most relevant drills to practice.  
This in turn would feed back statistically into their scores.  They would be able to track their progress visually (charts etc).

I have come across a similar idea for Fortnite by the name of Novos which I did briefly try.  Clearly the skills are not the same but the
idea of a dynamic training plan with statistical feedback is not new and I would like to acknowledge that even if such a level of functionality
is beyond the scope of this project.  I'd like to think the framework could be generaliseable to various disciplines whereby skill development
is key to learning and progression.
