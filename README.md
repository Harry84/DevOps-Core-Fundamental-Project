# DevOps-Core-Fundamental-Project: 
## Harry Potter Sorting Hat

This is a basic web app intended to allow users (aka Prospective Hogwarts Students) to register to attend one of the four houses at Hogwarts.

As a MVP two tables will be included in a relational db.  Users enter their name via a form and request to join one of the four houses.
Their name is then appended to a list of students within each house which they can then see displayed on a roster/home page.

Ideally I will try to include a random element to assign houses (sorting hat) and potentially will extend to include another table, student 
years.

### Approach

I aim to utilise an agile approach to carrying out this project.  I will interpret user stories corresponding to my understanding of the MVP
and how it would apply in the case of this project.  I will then set tasks to enable this user stories on a daily basis.  Given the short 
turnaround time of the project I will view each day as its own sprint and try to allocate tasks to my Trello board on a daily basis, as well 
updating the backlog and completed sprint at the end of each day.  I will demonstrate I am doing this with numbered screenshots of my Trello 
board which I will include in this repo.

I will include links to accompanying documentation below.
